# Write a program to find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'poor' from a given string,
# if 'poor' follows the 'not', replace the whole 'not'...'poor' substring with 'good'. Return the resulting string.
# Sample String : 'The lyrics is not that poor!'
# 'The lyrics is poor!'
# Expected Result : 'The lyrics is good!'
# 'The lyrics is poor!'

# First, find substring 'not'. if no match, return unchanged string.
# Second, find substring 'poor'. if no match, return unchanged string.
# Third, if 'poor' is found after 'not, replace ('not'...'poor') with 'good'.
